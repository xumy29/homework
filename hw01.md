## Computer
# A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. 
# 计算机是一个通过计算机编程能接受指令，并自动做算术或逻辑运算的装置。
## Computer science
Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers.
计算机科学是一个研究形成计算机设计与应用的基础的理论、实验及工程的学科。
## Software
Computer software, or simply software, is a generic term that refers to a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built, that actually performs the work. 
计算机软件，简称软件，区别于构成计算机的物理硬件，是指指导计算机怎样工作的大量数据或计算机指示的一个总的概念，它是真正运行操作的主角。
## Software engineering
Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method.
软件工程是通过一个系统的方法对软件的发展进行工程上的运用的科目。
## Alan Turing
Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.[2] Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.
艾伦·图灵(1912年6月23日-1954年6月7日)是一个英国的计算机科学家、数学家、逻辑学家、密码专家、哲学家和理论生物学家。图灵对理论计算机科学有深远的影响，他的图灵机提供了算法和估计概念的规范，被认为是后来所有计算机的模型。
## Moore's law
Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. 
摩尔定律指通过观察，密集集成电路中的晶体管数量大概每两年翻一番。
