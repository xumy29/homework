名词解释：
程序猿（Programmer，Computer Programmer或Coder），它可以指在程序设计某个专业领域中的专业人士，或是从事软件撰写，程序开发、维护的专业人员。但一般Coder特指进行编写代码的编码员。 
随着时代的发展，对程序员的要求也在变化，需要他们掌握更多的知识与技能，如：UML、单元测试、各种方法论等，以满足随时代不断变化的商业、科技与应用等需求。 

A programmer, developer, dev, coder, or software engineer is a person who creates computer software. The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computers or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. One who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst. 
A programmer's primary computer language (Assembly, COBOL, C, C++, C#, Java, Lisp, Python, etc.) is often prefixed to these titles, and those who work in a web environment often prefix their titles with web. 
A range of occupations, including: software developer, web developer, mobile applications developer, embedded firmware developer, software engineer, computer scientist, or software analyst, while they do involve programming, also require a range of other skills. The use of the simple term programmer for these positions is sometimes considered an insulting or derogatory simplification.
