# 解释名词
## 1) Method of complements
In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers.

## 2) Byte
The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. 

字节是数字信息的单位，通常由8 位组成，表示二进制数。从历史上看，字节是用于在计算机中编码单个文本字符的位数，因此它是许多计算机体系结构中最小的可寻址存储单元。
## 3) Integer(computer science)
In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers.

在计算机科学中，一个整数是一个基准的积分数据类型，一个表示一定范围内的整数的数据类型。
## 4) Floating point
In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision. For this reason, floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers, which require fast processing times. 

在计算中，浮点运算（FP）是使用实数的公式表示作为近似，以达到范围和精度之间的折衷的算术。出于这个原因，浮点计算经常在包括非常小和非常大的实数的系统中被找到，这需要快速的处理时间。
