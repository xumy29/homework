(1) LOD #1 –> STO X –> LOD X –> ADD #3 –> STO Y –> HLT   
00010100 00000001 -> 00000101 bbbbbbbb -> 00000100 bbbbbbbb -> 00010000 00000011 -> 00000101 bbbbbbbc -> 00001111 00000000  
(2)Main memory –> fetch instruction –> Decode instruction –> Registers –> Get data –> Execute the instruction –> Main memory  
(3)IR:指令寄存器，用于储存正在执行的一条指令；   PC:程序寄存器，用于存放CPU当前执行到的指令的地址；  ACC:累加寄存器，为ALU提供一个工作区，暂时储存ALU运算结果。  
(4)a is a address which stores a value 1;  
c is a address which stores value in a plus 3.
## 简答题   
1）What are stored in memory? 2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place? 3） Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.  

(1)Address and data.

(2)Yes.

(3)Instruction Format includes two parts:  
– The 8-bit instruction specifier（命令指示）  
假定我们有一个8位的命令指示，00010000， 第四位表示寻址模式，若值为1，则表示后面八位操作数是数值，若为0则表示操作数是该地址的内容； 后四位是操作码，对应相应的操作，如0000表示ADD（加），0001表示SUB（减）。  
 
 – And optionally, the 8-bit operand specifier(操作数)  
 八位数字可能表示地址或数值，这由命令指示的第四位决定。

命令指示和操作数构成一个完整的命令，如00010000 00000101 表示加5；  又如00000000 00000011 表示增加一个值储存在地址3中（初始值为0）。

(1)汇编语言  
 Assembly languages （汇编语言） A language that uses mnemonic codes（助 记忆符号） to represent machine language instructions – The programmer uses these alphanumeric  codes in place of binary digits – A program called an assembler reads each of the instructions in mnemonic form and translates it into the machine-language equivalent（翻译成对应的机器语言）
  
(2)编译（Compiler）  
A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program. A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.

However, there are many different types of compilers. If the compiled program can run on a computer whose CPU or operating system is different from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is a cross-compiler. A bootstrap compiler is written in the language that it intends to compile. A program that translates from a low-level language to a higher level one is a decompiler. A program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a source-to-source compiler or transpiler. A language rewriter is usually a program that translates the form of expressions without a change of language. The term compiler-compiler refers to tools used to create parsers that perform syntax analysis.  

(3)命令式语言（Imperative programming）  
In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.

The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result.  

Higher-level imperative languages use variables and more complex statements, but still follow the same paradigm. Recipes and process checklists, while not computer programs, are also familiar concepts that are similar in style to imperative programming; each step is an instruction, and the physical world holds the state. Since the basic ideas of imperative programming are both conceptually familiar and directly embodied in the hardware, most computer languages are in the imperative style.  

(4)函数编程语言（Functional programming)  

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations[1] instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating side effects, i.e., changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.

Add:the differences between imperative and functional programming:  
the former focuses on how to do;the latter focuses on what to do.  
the former is one step after another; the latter is more like a reflection.  
the latter is more brief .  

(5)过程式编程（Procedural programming）  
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.   
Procedural programming languages are also imperative languages, because they make explicit references to the state of the execution environment.
